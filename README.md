<h1>Azure Virtual Machines Traffic Inspection (May 2023)</h1>
In this tutorial, I analyze and observe various network traffic protocols between Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark.
<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines) abbreviated VM. VMs are used to install the software that is used to analyze the traffic being sent.

- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used to connect to the virtual machines and it is one type of traffic observed in wireshark. 

- Various Command-Line Tools are used such as Command Prompt for ping commands and Powershell to ssh into the second virtual machine.

- Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, ICMP, DHCP) are observed in wireshark as both VMs communicate with each other under various commands.

- Wireshark is the network traffic analyzer used to observe the different types of traffic being sent between both VMs.

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 11 Pro (21H12)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>
<h2>Creating the virtual machines<h2/>                                                             

- Step 1a. - After signing in to your Azure account, go into Resource Groups and create a Resource Group.

</p>
<br />
<br />

1b. Give it a name (click review and create).

</p>
<br />
<br />

1c. Then click create and wait a few moments....

</p>
<br />
<br />

1d. The Resource Group is Created

<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

Step 2a. - Create two Virtual Machines. One Windows and one Linux (as displayed below).

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T74VAh7.png alt"Rescource Group"/?
</p>
<br />
<br />  
  
2b. Choose the resource group, name, region and operating system for the VM. Then click review and create.
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />                                                            
                                                            
2c. Choose the size, create a username and password, click the confirm box then click review and create. 
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
  
2d. Also create a VM using Ubuntu as the operating system
<p>

</p>
<br />                                                            
<br />
                                                            
2e. The virtual machine has been created                                                            
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9VZeEFz.png alt"Rescource Group"/?
</p>
<br />                                                            
<br />

Step 3a - Log in to VM1 using it's ip address

</p>
<br />
<br />  

Step 4a. - After logging in to the VM, navigate to Microsoft Edge and install Wireshark

</p>
<br />
<br />
Now that you have logged in and installed WireShark you can continue on to the traffic observation steps detailed below.
<br />
<br />
<br />  

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>
These observations are made by inputting commands that corresond to the type of traffic one wishes to observe and then filtering Wireshark by the corresponding traffic type.
<br />
<br />

Below is RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) traffic observation after filtering for RDP traffic in Wireshark

</p>
<br />


Below are the steps for ICMP (nternet Control Message Protocol) traffic observation from a perpetual ping and ICMP traffic stop after the inbound firewall rule is set 
<br />
5a. Obtain VM2's IP Address

</p>
<br />
<br />
                                                                                                 
5b. Set the perpetual ping comand to ping VM2 and observe the ICMP traffic
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />

5c. Change the Inbound firewall rule to deny ICMP traffic

<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />


5d. Observe the ping request times out after the firewall rule was put in place
(*note - The ping request timed out due to the ICMP traffic being denied as the firewall rule blocked the traffic)
